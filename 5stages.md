# 5 Stages of Ethical Hacking
### _Only use the information provided here for ethical purposes with permission_

1. Reconnaissance / Information Gathering

_Passive: f.e Going to Google and searching for somebody_

_Active: f.e We use tools like NMAP and scana ctively against the target, open ports, vulnerabilities etc._

2. Scanning & Enumerating (Nmap, Nessus, Nikto etc)

3. Gaining Access ("Exploiting")
 
5. Maintaining Access
 
7. Covering Tracks


### Passive Recon overview

different types of passive recon: Physical/Social

Physical meaning actually going on site doing a physical engagement or social engineering side like doing phishing assesment or physical interaction

physical recon we might utilise f.e Satellite images, Drone recon, building layout

Social more involves f.e Badge photos, Desk photos, computer photos, name, job, phone number, manager etc

### Web / Host

When we get Web or Host Assessment, first thing we should do is what called "Target Validation", Always should be done not to accidently attack wrong target

Useful Websites: [WHOIS](https://who.is/), [NSLOOKUP](https://www.nslookup.io/),[DNSRECON](https://www.kali.org/tools/dnsrecon/)

Fingerprinting We understand whats running on the website, what kind of service out there, what webs erver they running, or what ports are open there etc. 

Useful Tools: NMAP, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat

Data Breaches: Are most common way when doing external assesssment that we get into entworks, when we talking about data breaches we mean breahed incidents from the apst that has leaked data.

Useful Tools: HaveIBeenPwned, Breach-Parse, WeLeakInfo
