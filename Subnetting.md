# Subnetting

Netmask also known as Submask demonstrates the bits amount of the IP Address,

f.e - 255.255.255.0, Each 255 indicates 8 bits, and in each 255 number octet all switches are 1, 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 can be also met with /24 indicator

This is a Class C IP Address Subnet, Please note that Classless IPs will have Subnets with varying bits amounts (f.e 255.255.240.0)

Hosts are how many bits are switched off, in our Class C IP Example there are 8 bits switched off, So it would be 2^8 - 2 (254) (the minus 2 is broadcast and ...) This one usually used in small businesses and households.
