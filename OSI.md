# OSI Model
### Network Layers

As we mentioned before, there are several layers, for example that On Layer 3 we communicate through IPs, Network etc.

To remember all the layers, we can remember the following

### "Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away".

1   P - Physical  ( f.e Data Cables)

2   D - Data  (Switching / MAC Addresses)

3   N - Network  (IP Addresses / Routing)

4   T - Transport (TCP / UDP)

5   S - Session  (Session Management)

6   P - Presentation (WMV, JPEG, MOV, etc)

7   A - Application (HTTP, SMTP)

For example we receive a call and someone asks why their internet doeasn't work, We ask them step by step similarly

"Is the cable plugged back of the computer? (l 1)"

"Does there glow a Green Lights? (l 2)"

etc all the way down,
